# CPE462 Intro to Image Processing and Coding
This project aims to implement a subband image coder in MATLAB. This encoder was tasked with performing: subband decomposition, scalar quantization, entropy encoding, producing a coded bit stream as a data file, reading the coded file and performing entropy decoding and subband reconstruction, and finally producing a reconstructed image in the same format as the input image. The project was implemented in a single MATLAB file with clearly marked sections of code to complete each of these objectives. The program was run twice with two different step sizes to demonstrate the change in peak signal-to-noise ratio and how the quality of the output image changes regarding the step size. The user specified the step size, and the input image was included in the projectâ€™s directory and could be changed for any image the user desires.
